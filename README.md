# The Jupyter Book template

This repository / website is a template for creating your own Jupyter Book. It is
meant to be paired with the **[Jupyter Book Guide](https://predictablynoisy.com/jupyter-book-guide)**. Check out that page for instructions
on how to fork/modify this template repository for your own book.

See the [live demo of the template here](https://predictablynoisy.com/jupyter-book).

## Explore this book

This website is an example of a Jupyter Book. You can explore the chapters of the book
by clicking on links in the sidebar to the left. Or, you can move linearly forward and
backwards by clicking the left/right arrow on your computer.

## Contribute or improve the book

Notice some inefficient CSS? A typo in the text? Want to add a cool feature so that others
can enjoy the improvements to Jupyter Books? Don't hesitate to [open an issue or a PR on the
Jupyter Book template repo](https://github.com/choldgraf/jupyter-book). We'd love your
help!
