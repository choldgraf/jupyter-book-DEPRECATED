# Jupyter Books

<img src="images/logo/logo.png" width=200 />

This is a guide and template for hosting your own book using
Jupyter Notebooks and Jekyll.

Here are some highlights:

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in `notebooks/`
* This site comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in `scripts/`)
* Pages can have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.
* The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.

This repository comes with some sample textbook files from the Data 8 course
for Data Science at UC Berkeley. You can update these materials and all site
content with your own, and have a Jupyter-based textbook ready to go shortly!

Here are a few links of interest:

* **[A short guide to deploying your own textbook](https://predictablynoisy.com/textbooks-with-jupyter/guide/01_overview/)**
* **[The markdown version of the guide in this repo](_guide/)**
